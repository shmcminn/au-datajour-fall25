# Medill Data Journalism Fall 2023

**Instructor**: Sean McMinn

**Contact**: Slack is best. On weekdays, I will try to respond to all messages within 24 hours. If you do not hear from me within that time frame, feel free to send a follow-up message.

**Class time**: 6 p.m. - 9 p.m., Mondays

**Office hours**: During class or by appointment

**Description**: Reporters find news every day by talking to people and unearthing their secrets. In this class, we're going to do the same — but with data. This is not a graphic design or programming class, but a course that will teach you how to use the huge number of datasets available to reporters in order to break news and help inform your audience through text and visuals. By the end of this course, you should be able to:

* Find datasets relevant to a story you're reporting
* Process and clean data
* Analyze and "interview" data to find a story within it
* Visualize and present a story based on data
* Speak the language of reporters and technologists who use data to tell stories
* Identify common problems with data and think critically about its use in news reporting

Special thank you to [Rachel Shorey](https://github.com/rshorey/digitalframeworks-spring18) of The New York Times for contributions to the class materials and its syllabus.


### Expectations

* Come to class or let me know if you can't make it. I understand that situations occur that make it difficult to attend, and I'm willing to help you if you get in touch with me. Either way, you will be responsible for the material unless otherwise agreed upon.
* You will receive two excused absences. **A third absence for any reason will result in you losing one-half of your attendance points (10% pts. off your grade). A fourth absence for any reason will earn you a zero on attendance, and you will not be able to earn more than a B- in the class.** 
* Complete assignments either in class or as homework due before the next class. That means assignments are due at 6 p.m. on Tuesdays, unless otherwise stated.
   * Late assignments will only be accepted if you contact me and we reach an agreement **before** the class in which it was originally due. 
* Submit assignments on Github (instructions in first lecture) as specified in the assignment.
* Consume the news every week, and come to class ready to share at least one story that uses data in a substantial way. I will randomly select two students to share a story at the beginning of class, so please have a link ready to go (and I will do the same). This will count toward your participation/attendance grade.
* Subscribe (for free) and read The Department of Data in The Washington Post. Come to class prepared to discuss. I will call on people to talk about it and this will count toward your participation/attendance grade.
* Complete a final project
* I reserve the right to change this syllabus at any time, provided all changes are pushed to GitHub where you can track them in the "commits" section for this repository. If at any time you feel like a change I made isn't fair, you can tell me why and I'll reconsider it.
* Please make sure you have the following software:  
	* Microsoft Excel 
	* Sublime text editor (free)
	* Tableau Public (free)
	* We might dabble in some other free software as well, which we can download together. 
* I will use Slack as the primary means of communicating with the class, making your use a required element. Please make sure you check your Slack daily.
* All lectures/assignments/class materials will be available on Github.


### Grading

Your grade will be made up of three components:

* 20%: Class attendance and participation, including presenting data stories when I call on you to do so
* 50%: Assignments
* 30%: Final project

##### Assignment grading scale

* A: publishable with minimal edits
* B: publishable with significant edits
	* You cannot get more than a B on an assignment if there are any factual errors.
* C: would need reporter’s revision to be published
	* You cannot get more than a C on an assignment if there are significant factual errors.
* D: unpublishable, even with edits 
* F: did not complete work as assigned

**Note**: I will attempt to have all assignments graded within one week of you turning them in, and I will send you your assignment grades via email. You can ask questions/for feedback about assignments or grades at any time. If you'd like to see your overall course grade, please talk to me during class and I'll show you a detailed breakdown.

### Collaboration

Students are encouraged to discuss assignments. Your final work, however, must be entirely your own. A good rule of thumb is that no one else should take over your keyboard while completing an assignment. All Northwestern University policies regarding cheating apply to this class.
