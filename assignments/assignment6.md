# Assignment 6 - Automating charts in Datawrapper

**Due Thurs. Nov 13**

For this assignment, you'll follow [this guide](https://palewi.re/docs/first-automated-chart/index.html) written by Ben Welsh and Sergio Sanchez Zavala. This will give you a very basic understanding of how to use Datawrapper's API to create a chart, and — as Ben told me — it is a "total n00b onramp."

**You can stop once you get to the "Create many charts" section.**

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Before you upload your notebook to Github, delete your API key from it. Otherwise anyone will be able to use your Datawrapper account from it. 

Note: If this step does not work, `dw.Datawrapper().get_my_account()`, skip it and move on.

If you get an error at any point, compare the code you've written to the code from the guide and see if there are any small differences. Also read the error output in the notbook — from bottom to top — to see if you can figure out what's going on. You can also copy and paste your code and the error into ChatGPT and ask it for help.

Make these changes to the code and your published chart to show you know how to edit it:

* Change the chart color to American University blue `#004FA2`
* Change the chart byline to your name

For your assignment, you'll turn in:

* A Jupyter notebook file (assignment6.ipynb) that follows the steps in the walkthrough and successfuly creates a Datawrapper chart. 
* A markdown file (assignment6.md) that has a link to the Datawrapper chart you created using Python.

⚠️ IMPORTANT (just in case you missed it before): Before you upload your notebook to Github, delete your API key from it. Otherwise anyone will be able to use your Datawrapper account from it. 

## Extra credit opporunity

For up to 3 points on your final grade, keep going through the "Create many charts" section (you can stop when you get to the "Create a scheduled chart" section). Add that code to the bottom of the Jupyter notebook and add your new charts to your markdown file.
