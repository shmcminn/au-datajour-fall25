# Assignment Extra Credit 1

**Due Oct. 23**

For extra credit, you can turn in an early version of one of the data visualizations you will be creating for your final project. Note this does NOT lock you into having to use this visualization, but it is a chacne to get early feedback on the direction you're taking. 

This should be done in Datawrapper or another data visualization tool, not via pencil/paper.

This assignment can increase your grade up to 5 points in the class. If you earn, for example, a 50% on this assignment, it will increase your overall grade at the end of the semester by 2.5 points. If you earn 100%, your grade would increase by 5 points. 

It will be graded based on how closely you follow the data visualization principles we've discussed in class, including: 

* Accuracy
* Type of chart 
* Clarity in text (labels, headline, etc.)
* Visual choices (simplicity, reasonable color choices, etc.)

 This should be done on a *per person* basis, NOT per group. This means each person in your group should turn in their own different chart if you all want the extra credit. 


### Submit the following:

As `assignment-EC1.md`, you'll turn in:

* A link to your published Datawrapper chart or an embedded screenshot of your chart
* A short (2â€“3 sentence) explanation of what the chart shows and how it would fit into your final project
