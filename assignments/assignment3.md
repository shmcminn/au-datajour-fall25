# Assignment 3: Cleaning and analyzing data

**Due beginning of class 6 (Oct 2)**

## DC crime data

For [data on crime reports within one mile of AU's campus](../class3/dc-crimes-AU-mile.csv), use Pivot Tables in Excel to answer an interesting question in the data.

In your `assignment3.md` file, include:

1. The interesting question you answered and why it could meet standards of newsworthiness for AU's audience.
1. The steps you took to answer it, including how you built your pivot table.
1. The answer to the question.

## Final project data

Find a dataset you can analyze for your final project (or a related topic, if you haven't yet assembled data that you need for your project or decided on a topic). Clean the data as needed, then use Pivot Tables in Excel to answer an interesting question in the data.

In `assignment3.md`, include:

1. Link to the original dataset 
1. Any steps you need to take to clean it
1. The interesting question you answered and why it could meet standards of newsworthiness.
1. The steps you took to answer it, including how you built your pivot table.
1. The answer to the question.

## Story research -- on your own or in your group

One of the first steps in taking on any enterprise story is seeing what's been done already. 

On your own or in your group, look for any examples you can find of news reports that are similar to the story you'll be working on for your final project. 

Write a summary for your editor (me) of what has already been done and -- more importantly -- what _hasn't_ been done that you hope to tackle. For example, if you're doing a story on increasing police budgets, you might find several articles about inflated police department budgets in cities across the country, but maybe it hasn't been done in DC? Or maybe you're seeing lots of reports on budgets going up -- but you want to see where have police departments actually shrunk, and how that's affected public safety? 

In your summary, include links to the stories you find on your topic.

In addition to searching for other stories that have been done on this topic, please identify at least three high-quality datasets you could use in your story (you can change your mind on these later, but this is just to get you thinking about what's out there). For each, please write why the data source is trustworthy and what (if any) limitations it might have.

Be prepared to discuss with me and the class what you find. 

You only need to turn in one assignment for your group, but it would be helpful for me if everyone had a link to it in their Github repo for grading purposes. So it should work something like this:

* One person in group uploads the written markdown file to Github
	* That person shares the URL of the file with other students
* Other students in group link to that file as part of their `assignment3.md`
