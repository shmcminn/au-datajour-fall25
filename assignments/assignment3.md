# Assignment 3: Cleaning data

**Due beginning of class 5**

Find a dataset you can analyze for your final project (or a related topic, if you haven't yet assembled data that you need for your project). Ensure it is clean, then use a Pivot Table to ask an "interesting question" of the data. 

In `assignment3.md`, turn in the following:

* Link to the original dataset 
* Any steps you need to take to clean it
* What is the interesting qusetion you are answering? 
* What is the answer to the question?
