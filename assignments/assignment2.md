# Assignment 2

## Make your own datasets 

**Due by beginning of class 4**

Create a dataset either in Excel or Google sheets tracking the following (imaginary) grants from infrastructure bill projects funding. Use markdown to link to the dataset in your assignment2.md file. This can be done either by uploading the Excel file to github and copying the link, or hyperlinking to a Google sheet (make sure to set the sheet to "public" first).

Feel free to try ChatGPT to see how it handles this, then make any changes that you think need to be made.
