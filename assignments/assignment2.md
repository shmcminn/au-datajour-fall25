# Assignment 2

## Make your own datasets 

**Due by beginning of class 4**

Create a dataset either in Excel or Google sheets tracking the following (imaginary) grants from infrastructure bill projects funding. Use markdown to link to the dataset in your assignment2.md file. This can be done either by uploading the Excel file to github and copying the link, or hyperlinking to a Google sheet (make sure to set the sheet to "public" first).

Feel free to try ChatGPT to see how it handles this, then make any changes that you think need to be made.

*Below is a fake press release*:

The Department of Transportation today announced grants will be cut from the following companies, originally funded via the bipartisan infrastructure law passed in 2021.

TONY AND SONS of Newark, NJ, received $124,000,000 to develop a new sewage pipeilne that will direct Newark's sewage toward New York City. The company is owned by Antonio Tenor of Newark, NJ, 07114.

POTTER'S POWER of Wilmington, Deleware, received $13,000,000 to repair a bridge. The company is owned by Harriet Potter, a British citizen. 

GOOSE ELEVATED CONSTRUCTION of San Diego, Calif., received $86,000,000 to improve San Diego International Airport. The company is owned by Tom Cruise of Santa Monica, Calif., 90291.

KIM CONSTRUCTION of Malibu, Calif., received $33,000,000 to repair a pier. The company is owned by Kimberly Kard Ashy-Anne of Malibu, Calif.


## Story research -- on your own or in your group

**Deadline TBD (pending when we assign groups)**

One of the first steps in taking on any enterprise story is seeing what's been done already. 

On your own or in your group, look for any examples you can find of news reports that are similar to the story you'll be working on for your final project. 

Write a summary for your editor (me) of what has already been done and -- more importantly -- what _hasn't_ been done that you hope to tackle. For example, if you're doing a story on increasing police budgets, you might find several articles about inflated police department budgets in cities across the country, but maybe it hasn't been done in DC? Or maybe you're seeing lots of reports on budgets going up -- but you want to see where have police departments actually shrunk, and how that's affected public safety? 

In your summary, include links to the stories you find on your topic.

In addition to searching for other stories that have been done on this topic, please identify at least three high-quality datasets you could use in your story (you can change your mind on these later, but this is just to get you thinking about what's out there). For each, please write why the data source is trustworthy and what (if any) limitations it might have.

Be prepared to discuss with me and the class what you find. 

You only need to turn in one assignment for your group, but it would be helpful for me if everyone had a link to it in their Github repo for grading purposes. So it should work something like this:

* One person in group uploads the written markdown file to Github
	* That person shares the URL of the file with other students
* Other students in group create an assignment2.md file with a link to the URL
