# Assignment 4: Sketch a visualization

**Due Oct. 9**

We could create a whole other course devoted to data visualization tools (and those, in fact, do exist: [example 1](https://alignedleft.com/tutorials/d3/about) | [example 2](https://www.tableau.com/learn/training/20203)).

What we were able to cover in this class, though, were the _fundamentals_ that make for a good data visualization. So even if you don't have all the technical skills to create the visualization (yet), you should have an idea of what you makes for an effective visualization. 

## Makeover Monday

#MakeoverMonday is a data visualization group where people experiment with new ways to visualize data. There is an [archive on their site](https://makeovermonday.co.uk/) of weekly articles with data visualizations that people try to redesign to improve. 

For this assignment, you need to redesign two of the visualizations from the [Makeover Monday archive](https://makeovermonday.co.uk/). They can be any two you want, but your redesigned visualizations must be two different chart types (e.g. a bar chart and a line chart, a pie chart and a table, etc...). **You can use any tool you want to do this, but it may be easiest to work with a pencil and paper**, then take a picture of your work. You can also use Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, or whatever you're familiar with. 

Things to consider (and you will be graded on):

* Reducing visual clutter on the chart
* Proper chart type selection
* Annotating important data points, where appropriate
* Writing a clear hed and dek/subhed for the chart, where appropriate

Don't worry about:

* Exact sizing/scale of the data (especially if you're using paper/pencil)
* Typefaces/fonts
* Color -- *unless it is critical to understanding your visualization* (i.e. a map where darker colors = higher values)

**For `assignment4.md`, you'll turn in:**

* Links to the two original charts you redesigned. 
* Links to your chart redesign image files (you can upload PNGs or JPEGs to Github and link from your markdown file -- ask Google or use AI for instructions)
* For each visualization, a short list of what changes you made from the original **and why**
